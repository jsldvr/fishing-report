   {
     "test:e2e": "playwright test",
     "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui", 
     "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
     "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
     "test:codegen": "playwright codegen"
   }
   ```

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite Created**
   - `e2e/fishing-forecast.spec.ts` with 10 test cases covering:
     - Homepage functionality and content
     - Location input forms (text and coordinates)
     - Navigation flows
     - Mobile responsiveness
     - Form validation
     - Core user journeys

5. **Component Enhancements**
   - Added `data-testid` attributes to key components:
     - `weather-alerts` 
     - `marine-conditions`
     - `score-card`

6. **VS Code Integration** 
   - Playwright Test extension (already installed)
   - Playwright Test Runner extension installed
   - Intellisense support for test authoring

7. **CI/CD Ready**
   - GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`)
   - Artifact collection for test reports and screenshots

8. **Documentation Created**
   - `PLAYWRIGHT_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
   - Updated `AGENTS_CHANGELOG.md` with detailed setup notes

## âœ… Test Results

- **All 30 tests passing** (10 tests Ã— 3 browsers)
- **Execution Time**: ~1.3 minutes for full test suite
- **Cross-browser coverage**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Mobile testing**: Responsive viewport validation

## ðŸ”¥ Ready for Agent Review

The setup enables agents to:
1. **Review rendered frontend** - Take screenshots and analyze actual UI
2. **Test user interactions** - Simulate clicks, form fills, navigation
3. **Validate functionality** - Ensure features work across browsers
4. **Catch regressions** - Automated testing prevents UI breakage
5. **Generate test code** - Use `npm run test:codegen` to record interactions

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Debug mode with browser open
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Interactive UI mode  
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Test single browser
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium

# Generate tests by recording
npm run test:codegen
```

The fishing report application now has comprehensive E2E test coverage that will help agents better understand and validate the frontend functionality.
