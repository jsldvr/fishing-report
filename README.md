## üö® BREAKING: Scientists Hate This One Weird Trick! üö®

**Local Developer SHOCKS Fishing Community with Revolutionary Algorithm That Combines:**
- üåô **Ancient Lunar Mysticism** (because fish obviously check their moon calendar)
- üå§Ô∏è **NASA-Grade Weather Analysis** (yes, we're that extra)
- üìö **Farmer's Almanac Wisdom** (your grandpa was right all along)

*"I caught a fish once after using this script. Correlation definitely equals causation!"* - Totally Real User, 2025

## ‚ö° Features That Will Blow Your Mind (And Your Tackle Box)

### üß† **AI-Powered*** Moon Phase Analysis
*\*Not actually AI, just some trigonometry we found on Wikipedia*

Our patented** `score_moon()` algorithm uses ADVANCED MATHEMATICS‚Ñ¢ to determine exactly when fish are feeling snacky based on:
- Phase angles (because fish are geometrically sophisticated)
- Lunar illumination (fish prefer mood lighting)
- Ancient solunar superstitions (why question centuries of fishing folklore?)

**\*Not actually patented. Please don't sue us.**

### üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Wizardry That Makes Meteorologists Jealous**

We don't just tell you it's raining - we tell you if it's the *right kind* of rain for optimal fish psychology:
- Wind analysis (fish hate bad hair days too)
- Cloud coverage optimization (because fish are picky about their lighting)
- Temperature comfort zones (fish are basically underwater humans)
- Barometric pressure monitoring (fish have trust issues with weather)

### üìñ **Farmer's Almanac Integration** 
*"If it was good enough for your great-great-grandfather's fishing buddy, it's good enough for your AI-powered smartphone"*

## üéØ **The Science‚Ñ¢**

Our proprietary*** bite prediction algorithm considers over **FIVE WHOLE DATA POINTS**:

1. **Moon Score** (35% weight) - Because fish are clearly nocturnal astrologers
2. **Weather Score** (45% weight) - Fish check weather.com religiously  
3. **Almanac Score** (20% weight) - Traditional wisdom meets modern JSON
4. **Your Hopes and Dreams** (0% weight) - Sorry, we're realistic here
5. **Actual Fish Behavior** (0% weight) - Who has time to ask the fish?

***\*The word "proprietary" makes everything sound more impressive***

## üöÄ **Installation for Elite Anglers**

### Prerequisites
- A computer (revolutionary concept)
- Python 3.8+ (because we're not animals)
- Internet connection (fish data doesn't grow on trees)
- Unrealistic expectations about fishing success
- Willingness to blame the algorithm when you catch nothing

### Quick Start (AKA "The Moment of Truth")

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fishing-forecast.git
cd fishing-forecast

# Enter the matrix (create virtual environment)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the magic
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Prepare for disappointment... I mean, enlightenment!
python3 forecast.py --lat 35.4676 --lon -97.5164 --days 3
```

### Advanced Configuration (For Fishing Pros Only)

Want Farmer's Almanac integration? Set these environment variables and feel superior:

```bash
export OFA_API_KEY="your_secret_fishing_key"
export OFA_API_URL="https://api.almanac.example/v1/fishing?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&date={date}&apikey={key}"
```

*Note: Farmer's Almanac API may not actually exist. Details are for people who read documentation.*

## üìä **Sample Output (Prepare to Be Amazed)**

```json
{
  "date": "2025-09-23",
  "bite_score_0_100": 67.3,
  "components": {
    "moon": 29.4,
    "weather": 38.9,
    "almanac": 12.0
  },
  "moon": {
    "phase_angle_deg": 42.69,
    "illumination_0_1": 0.420,

    "precip_mm": 0.0,
    "cloud_pct": 25,
    "pressure_hpa": 1013.2
  }
}
```

*Look at all those decimal places! That's how you know it's scientific!*

## üèÜ **Success Stories**

> 
> ‚Äî Jake, Professional Exaggerator

> *"The algorithm predicted a bite score of 89. I caught nothing. Clearly the fish didn't get the memo."*
> 
> ‚Äî Sarah, Realistic Expectations Haver

> *"I don't even fish, I just run this script to feel intellectually superior to fish."*

## ü§ì **Technical Deep Dive (For Nerds)**

### The Algorithm That Will Change Your Life*

*\*Results may vary. Life-changing effects not guaranteed.*

Our bite prediction uses a sophisticated weighted average:

```python
def combine_scores(moon, weather, almanac):
    # This is basically rocket science
    if almanac is None:
        return 0.44 * moon + 0.56 * weather  # Math!
    else:
        return 0.35 * moon + 0.45 * weather + 0.20 * almanac  # More Math!
```

### Moon Scoring (The Mystical Part)

We calculate moon phases using the ancient art of trigonometry:
- New Moon & Full Moon = Peak fishing (fish are dramatic)
- Quarter Moons = Meh fishing (fish are indecisive)  
- Everything else = "It's complicated" (fish have commitment issues)

### Weather Scoring (The "Scientific" Part)

- **Perfect Wind**: 3-18 km/h (fish like a gentle breeze, not a hurricane)
- **Ideal Clouds**: 10-40% coverage (fish prefer Instagram-worthy lighting)
- **Temperature Sweet Spot**: 10-24¬∞C (fish are basically Goldilocks)
- **Rain Tolerance**: Light drizzle okay, torrential downpour not so much

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer** 

This script is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not responsible for:
- Empty coolers
- Disappointed family members  
- Existential crises about the meaninglessness of fishing algorithms
- Fish that don't read scientific papers
- The inevitable realization that fish gonna fish regardless of your fancy predictions
- Your spouse questioning your life choices
- The crushing weight of mathematical expectations vs. aquatic reality

**IMPORTANT**: Fish are notoriously bad at following algorithms. They don't have smartphones, don't check weather apps, and are generally unimpressed by your computational efforts.

## ü§ù **Contributing**

Found a bug? Fish not following the algorithm? Want to add more unnecessary complexity? We welcome contributions!

**Please include:**
- Screenshots of your empty tackle box
- Detailed explanation of how the fish personally wronged you
- At least three conspiracy theories about why fish are immune to data science
- Your grandmother's secret fishing wisdom (we'll convert it to JSON)

*Remember: The best fishing algorithm is still waking up early, going to the water, and spending time outdoors. But where's the fun in that when you can over-engineer everything?*
