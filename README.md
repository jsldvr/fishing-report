# 🎣 Tactical Fishing Intel Platform

**Mission-critical angling intelligence for the modern outdoorsman.** This ain't your grandpa's fishing app - it's a full-stack React/TypeScript tactical platform delivering real-time situational awareness for water operations across North America.

Built by suburban tacti-cool operators, for suburban tacti-cool operators who understand that fish are just another target requiring proper intel, timing, and environmental assessment.

## 🎯 Operational Capabilities

### Core Intelligence Systems
- **🌙 Lunar Phase Targeting**: Solunar theory calculations with astronomical precision - because fish operate on nature's timeline, not yours
- **� Marine Conditions**: Real-time NOAA CO-OPS integration with Great Lakes support - inland warriors get proper station selection now
- **🌤️ Weather Intel**: Multi-source meteorological data (Open-Meteo, NWS) with zero API key dependencies - operational security maintained
- **� Location Services**: GPS integration with fallback to manual coordinates - works when cell towers don't
- **⚡ Zero-Dependency Deployment**: Static assets only - deploys anywhere, runs offline when SHTF

### Force Multipliers
- **📱 Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for field use on any device
- **🔄 Automated Updates**: Nightly intel refresh ensures current conditions
- **🎯 Multi-Day Planning**: 7-day forecast window for tactical mission planning
- **📍 Continental Coverage**: US, Canada, Mexico coverage with proper timezone handling
- **🛡️ Hardened Architecture**: Production-ready codebase with comprehensive testing

## 🚀 Rapid Deployment

### Field Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the tactical package
git clone https://github.com/jsldvr/fishing-report.git
cd fishing-report

# Install dependencies (Node.js 20+ required)
npm install

# Hot development server
npm run dev
# Live reload at http://localhost:5173 - modify and see changes instantly

# Run full test suite
npm test
# Unit tests, integration tests, and marine station validation

# Production build
npm run build
# Optimized static assets ready for deployment
```

### Browser Verification (Playwright)

A deliberately small Playwright smoke suite verifies the responsive header in a
real browser (layout jsdom cannot check). It is not broad end-to-end coverage.

```bash
# One-time local browser install (binaries live outside the repo)
npx playwright install chromium

# Run the header smoke suite against a Vite dev server (auto-started)
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium
```

Firefox and WebKit are lower-frequency CI engine checks that run on `release/*`
pull requests, the weekly schedule, and manual workflow dispatch; install them
locally with `npx playwright install firefox webkit` if you need to run those
projects. Playwright's WebKit and Chromium are engine proxies -- they are not
exact coverage for branded Safari or Edge.

### Production Deployment Options

#### GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. **Enable Pages**: Repository Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"
2. **Auto-Deploy**: Push to `main` triggers automatic build/deploy pipeline
3. **Live URL**: `https://[username].github.io/fishing-report/`
4. **Nightly Updates**: Automated rebuilds at 0600 UTC for fresh data

#### Alternative Deployments
- **Netlify**: Drag `dist/` folder for instant deployment
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployments  
- **Apache/Nginx**: Serve static files from any web server
- **S3 + CloudFront**: AWS static hosting with CDN
- **Local Network**: Run on field laptop for offline operations

## ⚡ Mission Execution

### Target Acquisition Process

1. **Location Input**: GPS coordinates, city search, or manual entry - multiple vectors for target acquisition
2. **Time Window Selection**: 1-7 day operational window planning
3. **Intelligence Generation**: Real-time analysis with detailed breakdown of all contributing factors
4. **Mission Planning**: Use intel to optimize timing and resource allocation

### Threat Assessment Matrix

- **� 75-100 (CRITICAL)**: Prime engagement window - all systems green, maximum probability of success
- **⚠️ 50-74 (ELEVATED)**: Good conditions - favorable probability, proceed with confidence
- **❌ 0-49 (LOW)**: Suboptimal conditions - consider alternative operations or target adjustment

### Intel Breakdown Components

Each assessment provides weighted analysis from multiple intelligence sources:
- **🌙 Lunar Phase**: Astronomical calculations based on solunar theory - nature's operational tempo
- **� Marine Conditions**: NOAA station data with improved inland coverage (Great Lakes operators now properly supported)
- **🌤️ Weather Systems**: Multi-source meteorological analysis with field-relevant factors
- **🎯 Composite Score**: Algorithmic fusion of all intelligence sources for actionable assessment

## 🧠 Intelligence Algorithm

### Tactical Scoring System

**Field-tested algorithmic fusion** combining multiple environmental factors. This isn't some weekend warrior guesswork - it's precision-engineered assessment based on documented solunar research and operational meteorology.

#### Lunar Phase Analysis (Solunar Foundation)
```typescript
moonScore = 0.6 × |cos(2 × phaseAngle)| + 0.4 × illumination
```
- **Peak Windows**: New moon (0°) and full moon (180°) - maximum gravitational influence
- **Illumination Factor**: Brightness correlation with feeding behavior
- **Scientific Basis**: John Alden Knight's solunar theory with modern astronomical precision

#### Environmental Conditions Matrix
```typescript
weatherScore = 0.35×wind + 0.25×clouds + 0.2×precipitation + 0.2×temperature
```
- **Wind Assessment**: 3-18 km/h optimal (light to moderate breeze) - surface disturbance without equipment compromise
- **Cloud Coverage**: 10-40% ideal (partial overcast) - reduces UV penetration, increases activity
- **Precipitation**: Minimal preferred - light rain acceptable, heavy precip degrades conditions
- **Temperature**: 10-24°C operational zone (50-75°F) - comfort range for extended operations

#### Marine Station Intelligence (v1.2.3 Enhancement)
**MAJOR UPGRADE**: Fixed station selection algorithm that was returning distant coastal stations for inland operations.

- **Station Priority**: Waterlevels → Meteorology → Wind → Temperature → Tide Predictions
- **Coverage Improvement**: Great Lakes and inland water bodies now properly supported
- **Distance Optimization**: ~90km regional stations vs. 1000+ km coastal fallbacks
- **Validation**: Comprehensive test suite ensures proper station selection

#### Final Assessment Weights
- **Standard Configuration**: 44% lunar + 56% environmental
- **Enhanced Mode**: 35% lunar + 45% environmental + 20% almanac (when available)

### System Validation & QA

**Trust but verify** - comprehensive testing ensures reliable intel in the field:

```bash
# Full test suite execution
npm test
# Includes: algorithm validation, API integration, marine station selection

# Type safety verification  
npm run type-check
# Ensures no runtime surprises in production

# Production build test
npm run build && npm run preview
# Validates optimized bundle performance
```

**Field Testing Protocol**: Each algorithm change is validated against known conditions and historical data. The v1.2.3 marine station fix was extensively tested with inland locations (Milton, WI) to ensure proper Great Lakes station selection.

## ⚙️ System Configuration

### Operational Security

**Zero API keys required** - all data sources use public endpoints for operational security. No credentials to compromise, no rate limits to breach, no dependencies on third-party authentication systems.

```bash
# No environment variables required for basic operations
# All intelligence sources are public APIs or client-side calculations
```

### Mission Customization

#### High-Value Target Locations

Preload strategic locations in `scripts/build-data.ts`:

```typescript
const TACTICAL_LOCATIONS = [
  { name: 'Lake Tahoe, CA', lat: 39.0968, lon: -120.0324 },
  { name: 'Kenai River, AK', lat: 60.5544, lon: -151.2583 },
  { name: 'Boundary Waters, MN', lat: 47.9493, lon: -91.5008 },
  { name: 'Chesapeake Bay, MD', lat: 38.7849, lon: -76.8721 },
  // Add your AO's prime fishing intel locations
];
```

#### Algorithm Tuning

Fine-tune assessment weights in `src/lib/forecast.ts` based on local conditions:

```typescript
// Environmental factor weights (adjust for regional preferences)
const weatherScore = 0.35*windS + 0.25*cloudS + 0.2*precipS + 0.2*tempS;

// Final intelligence fusion weights
const standardMode = { moon: 0.44, weather: 0.56 };                    // Base configuration
const enhancedMode = { moon: 0.35, weather: 0.45, almanac: 0.20 };     // With third-party intel
```

### Marine Station Configuration (v1.2.3)

**Station Selection Priority** (automatically optimized):
1. `waterlevels` - Great Lakes, rivers, coastal monitoring
2. `meteorology` - Comprehensive weather stations  
3. `wind` - Wind monitoring (Great Lakes optimized)
4. `watertemperature` - Temperature monitoring
5. `tidepredictions` - Coastal tide predictions (fallback only)

This ensures inland operators get relevant regional stations instead of distant coastal fallbacks.
