### NOAA Marine Station Selection Fix

- **Fixed** bug where inland locations (e.g., Milton, WI) returned distant coastal stations (e.g., Quantico, VA at 1000+ km)
- **Root Cause:** Algorithm only searched for `tidepredictions` stations, excluding Great Lakes/inland stations
- **Changed** `findNearestStation` to search multiple station types in priority order:
  1. `waterlevels` - Great Lakes, rivers, coastal water levels
  2. `meteorology` - Widespread weather stations
  3. `wind` - Wind monitoring (Great Lakes friendly)
  4. `watertemperature` - Water temperature monitoring
  5. `tidepredictions` - Coastal tide predictions (fallback only)
- **Added** comprehensive test suite (`tests/noaaFix.test.ts`, `tests/noaaMarine.test.ts`) demonstrating issue and fix
- **Created** `src/lib/noaaStationTypes.ts` documenting NOAA CO-OPS station types and selection strategy
- **Result:** Inland locations now find appropriate regional stations (~90km) instead of distant coastal stations
