# Changelog

## 2025-10-19
### WX Outlook Header Flex Cleanup
- **Removed** flex-based layout from the outlook header and controls to return the section to block flow for the upcoming styling iteration.
- **Realigned** `#wx-outlook-controls` so the controls set anchors to the right edge per the revised layout direction.
- **Adjusted** `#wx-outlook-attribution` to stack on mobile while restoring flex alignment from the small breakpoint upward, including the requested source paragraph spacing tweak.
- **Stacked** `#wx-location-form` inputs on mobile by defaulting the layout to a column flex direction and restoring the row alignment from the small breakpoint.

### Astronomical Timezone Alignment Fix
- **Refactored** sun and moon time calculations to derive instants in the forecast location's timezone instead of the server locale.
- **Adjusted** solar time corrections to leverage real timezone offsets, eliminating multi-hour sunrise/sunset skew on the results page.
- **Updated** solunar period generation to reuse the timezone-aware instants so downstream formatting stays accurate.
- **Verified** the build (`npm run build`) to ensure the TypeScript refactor compiles cleanly.

### Forecast Metric Helper Text
- **Clarified** the Moon metric header with inline guidance describing how lunar phase strength influences bite scoring.
- **Explained** the Weather metric header with helper copy detailing which conditions contribute to the score.
- **Styled** new helper text with compact typography to preserve the metric layout.

### GPS Lock Icon Fix
- **Replaced** the garbled glyph on the Home page GPS button with the intended üìç icon to restore the ‚ÄúGPS Lock‚Äù label.

### WX Location Acquisition Parity
- **Matched** the WX page coordinate handling with the home workflow by validating against the North America bounds before applying updates.
- **Implemented** the multi-phase geolocation flow (quick lookup, watch fallback, cached retry, and IP-based estimate) while keeping the minimal WX UI intact.
- **Auto-seeded** the WX form with smart geolocation on load without surfacing spinner noise unless the user explicitly requests GPS.

### WX NWS Attribution Details
- **Extended** the 5-day outlook fetcher to pull the issuing NWS forecast office metadata alongside the forecast.
- **Augmented** the WX outlook attribution line to cite the responsible office name, location, and ID so users know which local office issued the guidance.
- **Tweaked** the attribution layout to break the office detail onto its own line and prevent duplicate city/state labels.
- **Reworked** the WX outlook header into stacked sections with widened desktop spacing so titles, unit toggles, and attribution never overlap.
